     * segments are identified in Big Segment data.
     *
     * This string is not identical to the segment key-- the SDK will add other
     * information. The store implementation should not be concerned with the
     * format of the string. Each value in the array is true if the context is
     * explicitly included in the segment, false if the context is explicitly
     * excluded from the segment-- and is not also explicitly included (that
     * is, if both an include and an exclude existed in the data, the include
     * would take precedence). If the context's status in a particular segment
     * is undefined, there should be no key or value for that segment.
     *
     * This array may be cached by the SDK, so it should not be modified after
     * it is created. It is a snapshot of the segment membership state at one
     * point in time.
